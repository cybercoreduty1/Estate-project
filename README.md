 This project is a web application called SmartHomesNaija that helps users find, rent, and buy houses across Nigeria. Built with Python (Flask) and PostgreSQL, the app will let users search for properties by state, local government area (LGA), or radius from a location. Users can buy homes outright, pay yearly rent, save favorites, and view full property details (photos, videos, amenities, price, owner/agent details). Property owners (subscribers) can list homes for sale or rent; listings must be verified by an admin before appearing. The app will display statistics and progress (available vs sold/let properties) with interactive graphs, include integrated payment options, show map directions to properties, support distance-based searches, and provide a chatbot for customer support.
