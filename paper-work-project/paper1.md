<h1><b> Key features (concise)</b></h1>

User registration, login, and profile management

Browse/search properties by state, LGA, city, or radius (distance)

Property detail pages with images, video, price, amenities, and map location

Favorite/save properties to a user’s dashboard

Subscriber flow: owners/agents can list properties; admin verification workflow

Buy or pay rent (yearly) with integrated payment gateway(s)

Map directions and distance-based search (nearby or far)

Dashboard with analytics: available vs sold/let, new listings, revenue, etc. (graphs)

Chatbot for customer support and basic property inquiries

Admin panel: verify listings, manage users, view reports, moderate content



<h1>Suggested tech stack<h1>

<h3>Backend: Python with Flask (REST API + server-side rendering where needed)

Database: PostgreSQL (PostGIS extension if you plan advanced geospatial features)

ORM: SQLAlchemy (or Flask-SQLAlchemy)

Authentication: JWT or Flask-Login (plus email verification / password reset)

Frontend: Flask templates with Bootstrap/Tailwind OR single-page app with React/Vue (optional)

Maps: Google Maps, Mapbox, or OpenStreetMap + Leaflet for map view and routing

Payments: Stripe, Paystack (Nigeria-friendly), Flutterwave, or similar

Chatbot: Basic rule-based bot + integration with Dialogflow / Rasa for smarter replies

Hosting: Docker containers on cloud (DigitalOcean, AWS, or Heroku alternatives)

CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

Logging & monitoring: Sentry / Prometheus + Grafana (optional)<h3>


<h1>Data model (core tables)<h1>

<h3>users (id, name, email, phone, role [user/subscriber/admin], password_hash, created_at, etc.)

properties (id, owner_id, title, description, price, type [sale/rent], rent_period, state, lga, city, address, latitude, longitude, verified(boolean), status [available/sold/let], created_at, updated_at)

property_media (id, property_id, file_url, media_type [image/video], caption)

favorites (id, user_id, property_id, created_at)

listings_audit (id, property_id, action, admin_id, notes, timestamp)

transactions (id, user_id, property_id, amount, currency, payment_status, payment_provider, type [deposit/purchase/rent], created_at)

analytics_events (optional: for tracking views, inquiries, saves)

chats/messages (for chatbot or human support transcripts)<h3>


<h1>MVP roadmap — phases & steps<h1>

<h2>Phase 0 — Planning</h2>

Finalize feature list and prioritize (MVP vs later).

Create wireframes for main pages: home, search results, property detail, listing form, dashboard, admin panel.

Design database schema and API endpoints.

<h2>Phase 1 — Core MVP</h2>

Setup project skeleton (Flask app, virtualenv, config, DB).

Implement user auth (register/login/email verification).

CRUD for properties (owner can create; admin verification toggle).

Property listing page + search by state/LGA/city.

Property detail page with media upload (images first).

Favorites functionality.

Basic admin panel to verify listings.

<h2>Phase 2 — Payments, Maps & UX</h2>

Integrate payment provider(s) for purchases and rent.

Add map view and geolocation (store lat/lon). Implement radius search (use PostGIS or haversine).

Improve property search filters (price, type, bedrooms, amenities).

Responsive UI and better media handling (video, image optimization).

<h2>Phase 3 — Analytics, Chatbot & Polish</h2>

Dashboard analytics with charts (available vs sold/let, revenue).

Build chatbot (start with FAQ/rule-based; extend to ML/NLP later).

Add email/SMS notifications for listing status and transactions.

Security hardening, tests, documentation, deploy to production.

<h1>Non-functional requirements & suggestions<h1>

Security: input validation, rate limiting, CSRF protection, secure password hashing (bcrypt/argon2).

Scalability: paginate listings, use cloud storage (S3-compatible) for media.

Performance: database indexes on search fields (state, lga, price, lat/lon).

Compliance: handle user data according to privacy practices; PCI considerations for payments.

Testing: unit tests for API, integration tests for payment flows.
